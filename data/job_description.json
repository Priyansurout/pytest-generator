  "task_description": "Generate pytest unit test cases from function signatures and docstrings. The input is a function interface that includes a function signature with type hints, a docstring containing Args, Returns, and Raises sections, an optional dependency declaration in the docstring in the form \"# Dependencies: func1(), func2()\" if external dependencies exist, and no implementation code beyond these interface components. The output should be pytest test code that includes the required imports (pytest and unittest.mock), parametrized tests with 2–3 cases demonstrating usage patterns, mocking of all external dependencies, edge case testing, assertions for both return values and mock call verification, and error tests for each specified exception type. The test code must contain a maximum of three test functions per example and follow proper formatting with four-space indentation and no markdown or headers.",
  "input_description": "A function interface with a signature, a docstring including Args, Returns, and Raises sections, and an optional dependency declaration inside the docstring. The function body should be empty (pass or ...).",
  "llm_as_a_judge_instructions": "Evaluate the generated pytest code and output \"good\" if it imports pytest and the function under test, uses proper pytest syntax (such as parametrization and exception handling), mocks external dependencies when needed, and includes tests for both successful cases and error conditions, focusing on overall functional correctness rather than minor stylistic issues. Output \"bad\" if the code contains syntax errors, is missing required imports, or does not meaningfully test the function."
